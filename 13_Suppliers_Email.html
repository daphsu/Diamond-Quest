        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">I am writing to you with what I admit is an unusual request.</p> 

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px"p>I am a graduate student at Rhode Island School of Design, doing research on the cultural value of diamonds. I am interested in the symbolism that diamonds hold and the relationships that women have with diamonds. Although there are many useful resources online, I have found that an important part of my research is to study diamonds in person. As jewelry businesses and cultural institutions with jewelry collections in my area have closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have not been able to go out and examine their diamond jewelry.</p> 

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">I understand that De Beers/Lucara Diamond/Tiffany & Co./Graff Diamonds/Signet Jewelers Ltd. is a leading corporation in the diamond business. The reason for my letter is to humbly request a diamond—any spare diamond you may have—to borrow for the duration of my research this spring semester. If this is not possible, I would be grateful if you could point me to other resources that may help me on my search.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Yours sincerely,</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Dee Diamonds</p>
