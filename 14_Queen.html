        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Madam,</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">First, I’d like to express my sorrow upon hearing Prince Charles’ diagnosis. I am sure you have the best doctors at his bedside, and I wish him a speedy recovery.</p> 

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px"p>I am writing to you with what is admittedly an unusual request. </p> 

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">I am a graduate student at Rhode Island School of Design, doing research on the cultural value of diamonds. I am interested in the symbolism that diamonds hold and the relationships that women have with diamonds. Although there are many useful resources online, I have found that an important part of my research is to study diamonds in person. As jewelry businesses and cultural institutions with jewelry collections in my area have closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I have not been able to go out and examine their diamond jewelry. </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">From my interest and research into the Crown Jewels, I understand that Your Majesty owns many beautiful and valuable pieces of jewelry. The reason for my letter is to humbly request a diamond—any spare diamond you may have—to borrow for the duration of my research this spring semester. If this is not possible, I would be grateful if you could point me to other resources that may help me on my search.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">Thank you in advance for your help. Please be well and healthy.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 36px">I have the honor to be, Madam, Your Majesty’s humble and obedient servant.</p>
