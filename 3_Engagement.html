        <p class="big">“Women are in unanimous agreement that they want to be surprised with gifts…. They want, of course, to be surprised for the thrill of it. However, a deeper, more important reason lies behind this desire…. ‘freedom from guilt.’ Some of the women pointed out that if their husbands enlisted their help in purchasing a gift (like diamond jewelry), their practical nature would come to the fore and they would be compelled to object to the purchase.</p>

        <p class="big">Women were not totally surprised by diamond gifts: some 84 percent of the men in the study ‘knew somehow’ that the women wanted diamond jewelry. The study suggested a two-step ‘gift-process continuum’: first, ‘the man “learns” diamonds are o.k.’ from the woman; then, ‘at some later point in time, he makes the diamond purchase decision” to surprise the woman.’”</p>
